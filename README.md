# odin-recipes
This is my first project. TOP wants me to create  recipe webpage, which I think is great. I'm still just learning how to use GitHub, so this should be helpful.
I feel like I cn write the beginnings of an HTML page in the VSC, but including GitHub will be different for me.
I should be able to set up basic HTML page, with a few links, images, and headings.
