# odin-recipes
This is my first project. TOP wants me to create  recipe webpage, which I think is great. I'm still just learning how to use GitHub, so this should be helpful.
I feel like I cn write the beginnings of an HTML page in the VSC, but including GitHub will be different for me.
I should be able to set up basic HTML page, with a few links, images, and headings.


Describe first progject

That was my first subject line. I tried to make it sounds commanding. My first project is the recipes, however I am also trying to understand this commit messages task. I believe that the README.md file is what my commit messages go to. Now to update Git up from the command terminal.
